# AR-Campus-Navigation-App
This project develops an AR-based campus navigation app that helps students and visitors easily find locations within the college. Using the mobile camera, GPS, and sensors, the app overlays real-time AR directions on the physical environment, providing intuitive and efficient navigation similar to Google Maps Live View.
